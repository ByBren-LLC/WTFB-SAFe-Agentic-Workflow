# Pull Request: Add System Architect Review Gates to Workflow Documentation [WOR-323]

## 📋 Summary

Implements all 6 System Architect review gate recommendations from WOR-321 Migration Automation Workflow Report to prevent future architectural governance gaps where complex automation is delivered without proper review.

**Linear Ticket**: [WOR-323](https://linear.app/wordstofilmby/issue/WOR-323)  
**Type**: `feat` + `docs`  
**Team**: `workflow` / `architecture`

**Prevention Mechanisms** (5-layer defense):
1. ✅ **TDM_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_MATRIX.md** - Identifies review triggers
2. ✅ **ARCHITECT_IN_CLI_ROLE.md** - Guides when to invoke
3. ✅ **AGENT_WORKFLOW_SOP.md** - Defines review process
4. ✅ **PRE_PR_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md** - BLOCKS PR without approval
5. ✅ **WORKFLOW_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md** - Self-validation before PR

**Result**: WOR-321-type gaps are now preventable with 5 independent checkpoints

## 📝 Additional Notes

### Why This Matters

WOR-321 investigation revealed a critical gap in our workflow: complex automation (710-line deployment script, 641-line CI/CD workflow, 3 TypeScript validation scripts) was delivered to production WITHOUT System Architect review. This violated architectural governance and created potential security/quality risks.

This PR implements all 6 recommendations from the WOR-321 report to ensure this gap never happens again.

### Key Features

1. **Clear Triggers**: 14 specific triggers for when System Architect review is MANDATORY
2. **Decision Support**: Decision trees and checklists guide ARCHitect-in-CLI
3. **Quality Gates**: Multiple checkpoints prevent gaps from slipping through
4. **Learning Integration**: WOR-321 gap used as example throughout documentation
5. **Self-Validation**: ARCHitect-in-CLI can validate own workflow before PR

### Success Metrics

**Immediate**:
- 100% of WOR-321 recommendations implemented
- 5-layer defense system against future gaps
- Clear guidance for when to invoke System Architect

**Long-term**:
- 100% of complex automation reviewed before PR
- 0% unreviewed scripts >100 lines in production
- Architectural governance enforced
- Higher team confidence in deliverables
