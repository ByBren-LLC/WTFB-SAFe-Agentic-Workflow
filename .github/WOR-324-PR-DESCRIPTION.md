2. **Placeholder System**: {{ARCHITECT_GITHUB_HANDLE}} and {{PROJECT_NAME}} for easy customization
3. **Clean Documentation**: No internal references, clear Contributing guide
4. **Example Usage**: Helps new users understand the workflow quickly

### Success Metrics

**Immediate**:
- 100% of OSS readiness issues resolved
- Repository safe for public release
- Clear onboarding path for new users

**Long-term**:
- Community adoption of template
- External contributions
- Positive feedback on documentation quality
