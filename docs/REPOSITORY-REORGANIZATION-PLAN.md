# Repository Reorganization Plan
## Cleaning Up Root Directory Clutter

**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Issue**: Root directory has 14 documentation files (should have ~6)  
**Goal**: Organize documentation into logical subdirectories while maintaining "clone and use" readiness

## 📋 Detailed Move Plan

### Phase 1: Create New Directories

```bash
mkdir -p docs/database
mkdir -p docs/security
mkdir -p docs/ci-cd
mkdir -p docs/archive
```

### Phase 2: Move Files

| Current Location | New Location | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| `/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` | `/docs/database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` | Database schema reference |
| `/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` | `/docs/database/RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` | Database security patterns |
| `/RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md` | `/docs/database/RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md` | Database security catalog |
| `/RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md` | `/docs/database/RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md` | Database operations SOP |
| `/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `/docs/security/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Security architecture |
| `/CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md` | `/docs/ci-cd/CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md` | DevOps documentation |
| `/README-TEMPLATE.md` | `/docs/archive/README-TEMPLATE.md` | Archived template |
| `/apply-workflow.sh` | `/scripts/apply-workflow.sh` | Script organization |

### Phase 3: Create README.md Files for New Directories

Each new directory needs a README.md index:

1. **docs/database/README.md** - Index of database documentation
2. **docs/security/README.md** - Index of security documentation
3. **docs/ci-cd/README.md** - Index of CI/CD documentation
4. **docs/archive/README.md** - Explanation of archived files

## 🔗 Reference Update Plan

### Files That Reference Moved Documents

#### High Priority (README.md and Onboarding)

**README.md**:
- Line 97: `[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)` - No change (stays in root)

**docs/onboarding/AGENT-SETUP-GUIDE.md**:
- References to `AGENTS.md` - No change (stays in root)
- References to `CONTRIBUTING.md` - No change (stays in root)

**docs/onboarding/META-PROMPTS-FOR-USERS.md**:
- References to `AGENTS.md` - No change (stays in root)
- References to `CONTRIBUTING.md` - No change (stays in root)
- References to `CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md` → `docs/ci-cd/CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md`

**docs/onboarding/DAY-1-CHECKLIST.md**:
- References to `AGENTS.md` - No change (stays in root)

**docs/onboarding/WOR-326-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md**:
- References to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (stays in root - no change)
- References to `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` → `docs/database/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`
- References to `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/security/SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`

- References to `RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md` → `docs/database/RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md`

#### Medium Priority (Agent Prompts)

**Agent prompts in `.claude/agents/` and `agent_providers/claude_code/prompts/`**:
- `bsa.md`: References to `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `system-architect.md`: References to `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `data-engineer.md`: References to `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- `security-engineer.md`: References to `RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md`, `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Count**: ~11 agent files × ~2-3 references each = ~25 references to update

#### Low Priority (Whitepaper and Other Docs)

**whitepaper/section-3-background-related-work.md**:
- Lines 427-429: References to `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**whitepaper/data/REPOSITORY_ARTIFACT_VALIDATION.md**:
- Lines 64-68: References to `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`, `SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, `CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md`

**whitepaper/README.md**:
- Line 241: Reference to `RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

**agent_providers/augment/AUGMENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md**:
- Line 70: Reference to `AGENTS.md` - No change (stays in root)

## 📝 .gitignore Additions

Add these patterns to prevent future clutter:

```gitignore
# Working documents and drafts
*.draft.md
working-*.md
temp-*.md
scratch-*.md

# Archive directory (optional - may want to track archived docs)
# docs/archive/*

# Personal notes
notes/
.notes/
personal-*.md

# IDE-specific documentation
.vscode/*.md
.idea/*.md

# Temporary documentation exports
docs-export/
*.docx
*.pdf.tmp
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After reorganization, verify:

### 1. No Broken Links
- [ ] Run link checker on README.md
- [ ] Run link checker on all docs/onboarding/*.md files
- [ ] Run link checker on all agent prompts
- [ ] Run link checker on whitepaper/*.md files

### 2. Agent Prompts Still Work
- [ ] Test BSA agent invocation
- [ ] Test System Architect agent invocation
- [ ] Test Data Engineer agent invocation
- [ ] Test Security Engineer agent invocation
- [ ] Verify all agents can find referenced documentation

### 3. User Journey Still Works
- [ ] Follow README Quick Start for Agents
- [ ] Follow docs/onboarding/AGENT-SETUP-GUIDE.md
- [ ] Follow docs/onboarding/DAY-1-CHECKLIST.md
- [ ] Verify all links in onboarding docs work

### 4. Repository Structure
- [ ] Root directory has ≤ 9 files (excluding hidden files)
- [ ] AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md remain in root
- [ ] All other docs organized in /docs subdirectories
- [ ] Each new /docs subdirectory has README.md index
- [ ] No orphaned files or broken directory structure

### 5. Git History
- [ ] Use `git mv` for all moves (preserves history)
- [ ] Single commit for reorganization
- [ ] Clear commit message explaining changes

---

## 🚀 Implementation Commands

```bash
# Phase 1: Create directories
mkdir -p docs/database docs/security docs/ci-cd docs/archive

# Phase 2: Move files (use git mv to preserve history)
git mv DATA_DICTIONARY.md docs/database/
git mv RLS_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md docs/database/
git mv RLS_POLICY_CATALOG.md docs/database/
git mv RLS_DATABASE_MIGRATION_SOP.md docs/database/
git mv SECURITY_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md docs/security/
git mv CI-CD-Pipeline-Guide.md docs/ci-cd/
git mv README-TEMPLATE.md docs/archive/
git mv apply-workflow.sh scripts/

# Phase 3: Create README.md files for new directories
# (Create these files with appropriate content)

# Phase 4: Update all references
# (Use find-and-replace or sed commands)

# Phase 5: Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: reorganize root directory documentation [WOR-XXX]

Move documentation files from root to organized subdirectories:
- Database docs → docs/database/
- Security docs → docs/security/
- CI/CD docs → docs/ci-cd/
- Archived docs → docs/archive/
- Scripts → scripts/

Keep AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md in root (AI assistant convention).

Update all references in:
- docs/onboarding/*.md
- Agent prompts (.claude/agents/, agent_providers/)
- Whitepaper sections

Root directory now has 9 essential files (was 17).
All documentation organized by category with README.md indexes."
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Before Reorganization
- **Root files**: 17 (14 .md files + 3 other)
- **User confusion**: High (which file do I read first?)
- **Discoverability**: Low (no organization)
- **Maintainability**: Low (hard to find related docs)

### After Reorganization
- **Root files**: 9 (essential files + AI assistant conventions)
- **User confusion**: Low (clear entry points)
- **Discoverability**: High (organized by category)
- **Maintainability**: High (related docs together)

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner Root**: Only essential files visible
2. **Better Organization**: Docs grouped by purpose
3. **Easier Navigation**: README.md indexes in each category
4. **Preserved History**: Using `git mv` maintains file history
5. **No Broken Links**: Systematic reference updates
6. **Better Onboarding**: Clear path from README → category → specific doc

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Broken Links
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive reference update plan + verification checklist

### Risk 2: Agent Prompts Break
**Mitigation**: Test all agent invocations after reorganization

### Risk 3: User Confusion
**Mitigation**: Update README.md with clear navigation, add README.md to each new directory

### Risk 4: External Links Break
**Mitigation**: GitHub automatically redirects old file paths for a period

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. ✅ Root directory has ≤ 9 files (AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md remain in root)
2. ✅ All other documentation organized in /docs subdirectories
3. ✅ No broken links in README.md or onboarding docs
4. ✅ All agent prompts still functional
5. ✅ User journey validation still passes
6. ✅ Git history preserved for all moved files
7. ✅ Each new directory has README.md index

---

**Status**: PLAN READY - Awaiting approval to implement

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (move files + update references + test)

**Recommended Ticket**: Create new Linear ticket (e.g., WOR-327) for this reorganization work
