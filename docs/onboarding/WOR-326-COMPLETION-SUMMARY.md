## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **User Journey Validation is Critical**: Simulating new user experience revealed gaps that weren't obvious from developer perspective.

2. **Missing Files Break Trust**: Referenced files that don't exist (`.env.template`, install scripts) create frustration and abandonment.

3. **Onboarding Documentation ROI**: 1,605 lines of onboarding docs transform user experience from "confusing" to "excellent".

4. **Test Scripts Before Committing**: Always test shell scripts with multiple flags before pushing.

5. **Sanitization is Not Optional**: OSS templates must have zero PII or project-specific data.

---

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Review & Merge

**Impact**: Transformed WTFB-SAFe-Agentic-Workflow from "interesting methodology" to "production-ready OSS template" with comprehensive onboarding.
