  - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- [ ] Rebase onto latest `dev` or `__PRIMARY_DEV_BRANCH__` (no merge commits)
- [ ] All automated checks passing
- [ ] PR template used completely
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Linear history maintained

---

## Code Quality

- [ ] ESLint validation passing (`yarn lint`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`yarn type-check`)
- [ ] Prettier formatting applied (`yarn format:check`)
- [ ] No console.log statements (use proper logging)
- [ ] No commented-out code (remove or document why)
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants/config)

- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Performance implications considered

---

## Documentation Quality

## Sign-Off

**Completed by**: [ARCHitect-in-CLI / Agent Name]  
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Linear Ticket**: WOR-XXX

### System Architect Approval (if required)

**Required**: If ANY System Architect review trigger matched

- [ ] **System Architect reviewed all complex code**
- [ ] **Approval documented in Linear ticket**
- [ ] **Architectural decisions recorded (ADR if needed)**
- [ ] **All feedback addressed**

**Approval Reference**: [Link to Linear comment or ADR]

### Final Validation

- [ ] **ALL checklist items complete**
- [ ] **ALL quality gates passed**
- [ ] **ALL reviews obtained**
- [ ] **Ready to create PR**

**⚠️ IF ANY ITEM FAILS: DO NOT CREATE PR UNTIL RESOLVED**

---

## Example: WOR-321 Failure Analysis

**Gap Identified**: System Architect review NOT obtained before PR

### Items That Should Have Been Checked

- [x] Bash scripts >100 lines → ❌ NOT reviewed (deploy-migration-prod.sh, 710 lines)
- [x] CI/CD workflow created → ❌ NOT reviewed (migration-validation.yml, 641 lines)
- [x] Validation scripts >200 lines → ❌ NOT reviewed (3 TypeScript scripts)
- [ ] System Architect approval obtained → ❌ NOT obtained

### What Went Wrong

1. **Triggers Matched**: 3 different System Architect review triggers
2. **Review NOT Requested**: System Architect never invoked
3. **PR Created Anyway**: Quality gate bypassed
4. **Result**: Unreviewed security-critical code in production path

### Lesson Learned

**This checklist would have caught the gap before PR creation**

If this checklist had been used:
1. ✅ Identified 3 System Architect review triggers
2. ✅ Blocked PR creation until review obtained
3. ✅ Ensured architectural governance
4. ✅ Prevented unreviewed code in production
