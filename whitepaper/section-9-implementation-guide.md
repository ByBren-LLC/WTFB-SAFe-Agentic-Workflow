```typescript
interface PrimaryMetrics {
  delivery: {
    velocity: number;           // Features per sprint
    cycle_time: number;         // Hours from start to production
    success_rate: number;       // % of features delivered without rework
  };

  quality: {
    defect_density: number;     // Defects per KLOC
    escape_rate: number;        // % of defects reaching production
    test_coverage: number;      // % of code covered by tests
  };

  efficiency: {
    rework_rate: number;        // % of work requiring revision
    handoff_success: number;    // % of clean handoffs between agents
    pattern_reuse: number;      // % of implementations using patterns
  };
}
```

### 9.3.2 Secondary Metrics (Track after Month 1)

```typescript
interface SecondaryMetrics {
  documentation: {
    coverage: number;           // % of features documented
    accuracy: number;           // % of docs matching implementation
    usefulness: number;         // Team rating of documentation
  };

  learning: {
    pattern_growth: number;     // New patterns per sprint
    improvement_velocity: number; // Retro actions implemented

## 9.4 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 9.4.1 Pitfall: Over-Engineering Simple Tasks

**Symptom**: Using all 11 agents for a README update

**Solution**: Implement graduated complexity
```typescript
function determineWorkflow(task: Task): Workflow {
  if (task.estimatedHours < 0.5) {
    return 'single-agent';
  } else if (task.estimatedHours < 2) {
    return 'simplified-3-agent';
  } else if (task.risk === 'high' || task.complexity === 'high') {
    return 'full-11-agent';
  } else {
    return 'standard-7-agent';
  }
}
```

### 9.4.2 Pitfall: Skipping Gates Under Pressure

**Symptom**: "Just this once" becomes habit

**Solution**: Automated enforcement
```bash
# Linear/Jira workflow rules
if (ticket.label === 'urgent') {
  enforce('emergency-workflow')  // Different but still has gates
} else {
  enforce('standard-workflow')   // Cannot be overridden
}
```

### 9.4.3 Pitfall: Prompt Drift

**Symptom**: Agent behavior degrades over time

**Solution**: Version control and testing
```bash
# Prompt versioning
.claude/agents/
├── bsa/
│   ├── v1.0.md
│   ├── v1.1.md
│   ├── v1.2.md (current)
│   └── test-cases.yaml

# Automated testing
./scripts/test-prompts.sh --agent bsa --version 1.2
```

### 9.4.4 Pitfall: Context Overflow

**Symptom**: Agents crash on large codebases

**Solution**: Smart context loading
```python
def load_context_for_agent(agent: str, task: str) -> Context:
    # Load only what's needed
    base_context = load_spec(task)

    if agent == 'backend_dev':
        context = load_api_files()
    elif agent == 'frontend_dev':
        context = load_ui_files()
    elif agent == 'data_engineer':
        context = load_schema_files()

    return optimize_context(base_context + context)
```

### 9.4.5 Pitfall: Resistance to Process

**Symptom**: Team complains, bypasses workflow

**Solution**: Gradual adoption with quick wins
```markdown
## Week 1-2: Single High-Value Feature
- Choose feature with known complexity
- Run full workflow
- Celebrate quality improvement
- Share metrics

## Week 3-4: Two Features in Parallel
- Show efficiency gains
- Document time saved on rework
- Highlight prevented incidents

## Week 5-6: Team Choice Features
- Let team choose what to run through workflow
- They'll naturally pick complex/risky items
- Success builds confidence

## Week 7-8: Standard Process
- Make it the default
- Exceptions require justification
- Continue measuring and sharing wins
```

## 9.5 Scaling Strategies

```

### 9.6.2 From Traditional Development

```markdown
## Traditional to AI-Assisted Path

### Phase 1: AI Augmentation (Month 1)
- Introduce Cursor/Copilot
- Developers use AI for coding help
- Measure productivity gains

### Phase 2: Single-Agent Workflow (Month 2)
- One AI agent per developer
- Agent handles full feature
- Track quality metrics

### Phase 3: Multi-Agent Introduction (Month 3)
- Start with 3-agent workflow

- Show quality improvements

### Phase 4: Full Implementation (Month 4-6)
- Expand to all agents
- Implement gates
- Build pattern library
- Regular retrospectives
```

## 9.7 Summary

Successful implementation requires:

**Technical Foundation**:
- API access and budget
- CI/CD integration
- Monitoring and metrics

**Organizational Readiness**:
- Leadership support
- Team patience
- Learning culture

**Gradual Adoption**:
- Start small
- Measure everything
- Celebrate wins
- Learn from failures

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Regular retrospectives
- Pattern library growth
- Process refinement

The key is patience and persistence. The learning curve is real, but the benefits compound over time.
