## Acceptance Criteria Status

From WOR-325-FIX spec AC5:

grep -r "your-org" whitepaper/*.md | wc -l
# Expected: 0 ✅ PASS

# Expected: >= 3 ✅ PASS (3 occurrences)
```

## Files Modified

1. `/home/cheddarfox/Projects/WTFB-app/whitepaper/section-9-implementation-guide.md`
2. `/home/cheddarfox/Projects/WTFB-app/whitepaper/section-10-future-work-community.md`

Total: 2 files, 6 URL replacements

## Recommendation

Fix 5 successfully applied. The whitepaper now contains only valid, working URLs that:
- Point to the actual ByBren-LLC organization
- Properly indicate future resources (Discord)
- Provide clear paths for users to engage with the project

Ready for next fix implementation or final validation.
