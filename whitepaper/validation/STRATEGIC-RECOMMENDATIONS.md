**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Publish immediately** on arXiv.org (establish priority)
2. **Target ACM Queue** for rapid practitioner impact
3. **Submit to IEEE Software** for peer-reviewed academic credibility
4. **Use PR #212 as showcase** in template repository
5. **Formalize meta-circular validation** as reusable pattern
6. **Collect baseline data** for future statistical comparisons

**This is THE demonstration. Use it well.**
